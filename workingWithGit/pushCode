To push the code in your working directory so that it is present in your github account:

 git push -u origin master

   

IMPORTANT REMARKS: This assumes that your personal github repository is called "origin", 
                   you can verify this with the "git remote -v" command.
	  	   	
                   It also assumes that you want to push the changes in the branch called "master".
                   It may very well be that you have a development branch called something different 
                   and you want to push that one instead, then use the name of the branch you want.
