So you would like to add some changes into the central DesySusy repository. 

There are essentially two ways, the pull request being the preferred one. 
The pull request means: 
     "hey you, owner of the central repository, take a look at the differences between your repo 
     and mine and add them into your repository". 

Well. Sort of. If you want more truthful info, a pull request is more like:

     "hey you, owner of the central repository, take a look at the differences between THIS BRANCH 
      in my repo and THAT BRANCH in your repo and add them into your branch in your repo."


Anyway, to make these changes present in the central DesySusy repository through a pull request:
   
   0. The changes must already be in your PERSONAL github account. Take a look at pushCode to remember how.
   1. In your personal github account, click on "Compare and review", it's the green button.
   2. Verify that the changes shown there are indeed the ones you want to add into the central repository.
   3. make the pull request



IMPORTANT REMARKS:

1. It is mandatory that your personal github copy of DesySusy has been obtained through a Fork of the DesySusy central repo.
Otherwise the two repos cannot communicate through a pull request.

2. For the time being, to ACCEPT pull requests, one needs to log in the desysusy account on github and do it there.
