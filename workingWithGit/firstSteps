=====================================================================
GET A COPY OF THE REPOSITORY IN YOUR LOCAL DIRECTORY
=====================================================================
You have to do this to no matter what, so please read below.

There are several ways of doing this, but I think the optimal/canonical is to:

0) Once you have a personal github account and your are logged in...

1) Go to the DesySusy github account:
https://github.com/desysusy/DesySusy

2) On the right upper part, click on Fork.

   -This will create a copy of the DesySusy repository on the desysusy account in your PERSONAL github account. Read the sentence again, it's confusing.

   -Verify that in your personal github account, the new repostory exists and it's called DesySusy.


3) Now you have a repo in your github account, to make a local copy in your WORKING directory, simply do:
   git clone  https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/DesySusy.git
   
   where YOUR_USER_NAME is, against all expectations, your user name.

   -Verify that you have a directory called DesySusy and all the code is there.


WHAT TO DO IF:

i) You have a lot of code that is not present in DesySusy and you would like to add it to git.
   See the file addCode.

ii) Start working locally from the copy and save the changes in:
    a) your personal github account: see pushCode
    b) the central DesySusy repository: see pullRequest
